    <h2>Try your luck at beating me!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You are going to guess a number between 1 and 1,000,000.
        </li>
        <li>
            I will try to match your guess 20 times.
        </li>
        <li>
            For each of my answers, you have to say higher or lower.
        </li>
        <li>
            On the 20th try, if I couldn't match your guess, you win.
